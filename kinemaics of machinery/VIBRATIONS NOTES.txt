Properties of system elements
1. inertial force F = m*a = m * d^2(x)/d(t)^2
2. Damper Forces = c*d(x)/dt 
3. Spring Force = K*x

Deriving Equations of Motions

1. Equilibrium Method  
  { 1. Give delta(x) displacement ; 
    2. Draw Free body diagram ;
	3. Sovlve the equations of motions }

2. Energy Method {1. Solve delta(Total Energy)/dt = 0}

3. Rayleigh method
4. Lagrangian Method }_ Used for multi DOF or Continous system
5. Galerkin Method   }

Spring Mass system 

( m(block) + (m(spring)/3) )*d^2(x)/d(t)^2 + k*x = 0;

x = Asin(Wn*t + pHI)

Wn - sqrt( k / [ m(block)+m(spring) ] )

1 DOF forced Damped longitudinal

m*d^2(x)/d(t)^2 + c*dx/dt + k*x = F(External)

2. Forced Undamped Oscillation

F(External) = m*d^2(x)/d(t)^2  + k*x

Beam Deflection Oscillations

Wn = sqrt(g/delta_deflection)

Important point : 

Remeber the deflections of different types of beams

Energy Method 

E = K.E + P.E + intergral(c*x^2 , t)

Solve DELTA(E) = 0;

Page 22 - 26

All are Spring connected systems

RESPONSE ANALYSIS

1. Assume dispacement relavent to given problem
2.Find velocity and acceleration
3.Substitute and solve
4. Use initial conditions

Impulse Momentum Principle:

F*t = m(v2 -v1)

v1 = 0

v2 = A*w        -------(1)

w  = sqrt(k/m)  -------(2)

Response for Free undamped oscillations

solution of 

d^2(x)/d(t)^2 + w^2(x) = m..x + kx

x = Max_Amp(X)*sin(w*t + phi)

x  = Asin(wt) + Bcos(wt) 

Substitute the solution into the original equations for obtaining 
x , v , a , w   etc expressions

PAGE 43

Response for Damped systems


x = A*e^(alpha*time)
if(alpha > 0) increases else decreases

IMPORTANT :
(alpha_1*alpha_2) = [-c [+-] sqrt(c^2 - 4*m*k)] / 2*m

Critical damping quotient = Cc = 2*sqrt(m*k) 

Damping factor = Actual / Critical;

Types of Damped systems 
1. Overdamped   = Actual is very high
2. Critically   = Actual == Critical
3. Under Damped = Actual is low compared to Critical

logarithmic decrement 
delta = (2*3.14*Damping factor)/sqrt(1-(damping factor)^2) 

no_of cycles = (1/delta)*ln(x0 / x n)
